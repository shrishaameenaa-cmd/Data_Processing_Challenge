üßæ Real-Time Data Processing Challenges
üë©‚Äçüíª Overview

This repository contains implementations for four major data processing challenges using Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Python.
Each challenge focuses on a different aspect of data engineering, including preprocessing, streaming, incremental updates, and in-memory processing.

üßπ 1. Data Preprocessing Challenge (30%)
Task

Participants are provided with a raw dataset (e.g., customer transactions, IoT sensor data, etc.) and must clean and preprocess it using Apache Spark or Flink.

Requirements

Handle missing values

Resolve data type inconsistencies

Remove duplicates

Perform normalization/standardization

Apply feature engineering (e.g., new features from existing data)

Tools

Apache Spark / Apache Flink

Implementation

Loaded dataset into PySpark DataFrame.

Handled missing values and data type inconsistencies.

Removed duplicate records.

Normalized and standardized numeric features.

Applied feature engineering to create new attributes for better insights.

Exported cleaned dataset to Parquet format for downstream processing.

Results

‚úÖ Missing values handled efficiently.
‚úÖ Data types standardized.
‚úÖ Duplicates removed successfully.
‚úÖ Normalized and standardized dataset prepared.
‚úÖ Feature-engineered data ready for model training.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Real-Time Data Streaming Challenge (35%)
Task

Create a Producer‚ÄìConsumer application using Apache Kafka.
The producer should push real-time streaming data (e.g., sensor/log data) to Kafka topics, and the consumer should process and analyze this data in real time.

Requirements

Set up Kafka topics and ensure message distribution.

Process incoming data streams (e.g., calculate rolling averages, aggregate values).

Apply real-time machine learning (classification or regression).

Tools

Apache Kafka, Python, Scikit-learn, Apache Spark/Flink

Implementation

Configured Kafka broker and created required topics.

Developed a Python-based Kafka Producer for sensor data simulation.

Implemented Kafka Consumer integrated with Spark Streaming.

Applied real-time aggregation and analytics on the data stream.

Integrated a Logistic Regression model for live predictions.

Results

‚úÖ Kafka topics successfully created and managed.
‚úÖ Streaming data consumed and processed in real time.
‚úÖ Rolling averages and aggregates computed dynamically.
‚úÖ Live machine learning predictions performed successfully.

üîÑ 3. Incremental Data Processing Challenge (25%)
Task

Implement Incremental Data Processing using Change Data Capture (CDC) techniques to update data models in response to new incoming data.

Requirements

Capture data changes from a database or stream using CDC.

Process only changed data (not full reprocessing).

Update machine learning model or data structures incrementally.

Tools

Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Python, CDC tools (Kafka Connect)

Implementation

Built CDC pipeline using Kafka Connect to detect source DB changes.

Streamed only incremental records to Spark.

Updated existing ML model incrementally (without full retraining).

Logged accuracy improvements and update timestamps.

Results

‚úÖ CDC system captured database changes successfully.
‚úÖ Incremental updates processed without full reprocessing.
‚úÖ Models adapted dynamically to new data.
‚úÖ Efficient real-time updating demonstrated.

‚ö° 4. In-Memory Data Processing Challenge (10%)
Task

Use in-memory data processing (e.g., Apache Spark, SAP HANA) to analyze large datasets efficiently using RDDs or DataFrames.

Requirements

Implement in-memory operations for faster analytics.

Compare execution time with disk-based processing.

Demonstrate performance improvements.

Tools

Apache Spark, SAP HANA

Implementation

Loaded large dataset into Spark DataFrames.

Used .cache() and .persist() for in-memory storage.

Measured query execution time before and after caching.

Visualized performance improvements using metrics.

Results

‚úÖ Data cached in memory successfully.
‚úÖ In-memory operations 2‚Äì3x faster than disk-based.
‚úÖ High-performance analytics achieved with large datasets.
